## Overview

This project is a **Movie Management System** developed with Ruby on Rails. It allows users to manage movies, genres, and directors. Currently, the system is in **active development**, with the main focus on providing a complete solution for movie management with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities and the ability to upload movie banner images.

## Project Status

‚ö†Ô∏è **In development**: This is an early-stage project, and various features are still in the process of implementation. Changes and improvements are being made, so the system is not yet complete.
